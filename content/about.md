### Peter Rauhut

#### Software Engineer by day and gamer husband by night. 

I have been working in some factor within the SDLC for since 2010 years and studying programming since 2001. 

Starting professionally as a Black Box tester, I've worked as a Support Engineer, Performance Tester, and SDET for 
high performance enterprise security devices. Currently, I am a Software Engineer focusing in Python and Golang 
working in the Financial Sector.

In my free time, I play video games with my awesome wife. I enjoy and am very beginner in woodworking, smoking meats, and cooking.

This page will likely be for me to share whatever I'm feeling like sharing at the moment. It may be developer related or just whatever I'm learning
or ranting about.
