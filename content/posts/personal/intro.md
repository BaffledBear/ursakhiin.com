##### I've never really known how to start talking. It's something I struggle with in a lot of ways. 
This is my first blog post. I'll probably just talk a little about what my intentions for this page are, where I'm at, 
and mention my wife a bunch.

### Ursakhiin! The character!
My name is Peter and I'm a software engineer, by trade. I have an a-typical education, and a history of not being a 
Software Engineer. This post is about Ursakhiin.

##### Ursakhiin
*Ur•sa•keen*

A concatenation of Ursa, which is the latin for bear, and Khiin, which is the Draconic (Yes, Skyrim) for kin. 
i.e. Dovakhiin

*Proper Noun*

* Man who meets many criteria
    * Married
    * Wife calls him *Bear*
    * Likes Skyrim
    * Is not actually a bear
    * Bad at naming things

Yes, I know how the name sounds. We can get this out of the way and answer some FAQs.

* I do not own a bear costume
* The only growling I do is general grumbling in my sleep
* I do snore. My wife makes sure I know it.
* I do give great big hugs
* I do enjoy long slumbers
* I do love honey
* I do enjoy raw fish

I am also pretty sarcastic and have a dark sense of humor. I am not mean I just play that on TV. I make a lot of 
references to things.

### Blog! The goal
I like to learn. Something I am missing is a way to focus that learning, though. I hope to use this blog for that.
My goal is that I will pick a project to work on that will teach me some new skill and blog about it either as I'm 
working on it or as I complete it. Some of these projects will be technical, and some will not. I will try to start 
every project with an intro into it that describes what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and what new skills I'm going to 
learn for it.

For coding projects, I may eventually start streaming while I work on them. Currently, my dev computer would not take 
kindly to that, so it will have to wait. Longer projects will likely be broken up into multiple posts, posting about the 
state of where I'm at periodically. 

### Blog! What it's not
My hope is to not get political with any of my posts. I also hope to not lecture about my opinion on a given subject, 
and I will likely not make posts about any geek or pop-culture. The goal of this site is not to argue. There are many 
other places on the internet for that. Eventually, I will add comments. At that time, I always welcome feedback.

When I make a post, I may not execute a project in the most optimal way. Sometimes, I may use a technology or tool that 
is explicitly sub-optimal. Whatever the reasoning, I will try to include the decision-making process as part of the 
intro. 

### Wife! The Badass!
Ok. I didn't mention my wife as much as I thought I would. She does deserve a lot of credit for who I am though.

Before we met I had been single for 7 years. I had a few dates here and there but nothing past that. I was easily 
frustrated by people, I lacked patience, I didn't think very highly of myself, and I really struggled with 
communication. That last point really caused the other three to grow.

For some reason I didn't get frustrated with her as much, though, and she helped me with the communication problems. 
Since then, I've become more patient and don't frustrate as easily. I still don't have a high opinion of myself, but 
she keeps saying I'm great, so I've got that going for me.

Anyways, if you ever see us on the street just know that she's the reason I'm smiling.

### Finally! I know, 4 minutes is forever!
I think that's enough for this post. I'll eventually add commenting to these things but right now it's no big deal.
